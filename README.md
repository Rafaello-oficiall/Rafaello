# 🧪 My Software Engineering Playground

Hi! I'm [Your Name] — a beginner exploring the world of **software engineering**, one line of C++ at a time.  
This repository is my personal coding playground where I try things out, practice programming, and learn how to use Git and GitHub as part of my journey.

> I'm just getting started — no fancy experience (yet!), but I'm excited to learn and build.
